#  TailorTalk â€“ AI Calendar Booking Assistant

TailorTalk is a conversational AI assistant that books Google Calendar meetings from natural language messages like:

> "Book a meeting tomorrow at 4 PM"  
> "Schedule something on July 2nd at 10am"  
> "Set a meeting in 2 hours"

Built using FastAPI, Streamlit, Google Calendar API, LangGraph, and date parsing, this app turns casual language into real calendar actions.
